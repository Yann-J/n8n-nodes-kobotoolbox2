[KoboToolbox](https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) is a leading open-source mobile survey solution designed for field use, and adapted to non-profits use.

This node is an alternative to the built-in KoboToolbox node provided by n8n, maintained by the original author. It is maintained here separately because the releasing times from n8n team to integrate new developments is very slow, so this version will typically be ahead of the one packaged within n8n core.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation.
